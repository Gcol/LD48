          m_StringArgument: Thanks for sharing. This really means a lot you'd open
            up to me like that. Look if you're feeling defeated and you need to,
            have a cry - let it go - don't carry that bag of pain and sorrow and
            bitterness and disappointment with you - it'll eat you up from the inside,
            slowly. Then reach your inner Passion and tend its wounds. It needs to
            survive and live on - it's the fire to your chimney, you need it to survive
            - emotionally - you don't wanna be a robot stuck in a video game like
            me, it's a dull life with no harm, but also no thrills. Get better. Take
            the time you need - look after yourself... THEN come back with a vengeance
            and rise up like a butterfly, my little cocoon - take care now *gives
            you a hug and gently kisses you on the forehead*
